# internship-assigment 👨🏻‍💻
## Description
For this assigment you have to implement a small NextJS app that communicates with https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ API and does the following:

1. Index page that will list all posts using posts API provided by Jsonplaceholder API (You Should use SSR, data must be fetched during SSR)
2. If I clicked on a post it should open a new page for that post only
3. page called `/static` , this page will use static site generation functionality (SSG) to fetch and render all posts (It is similar to index but it should use static site generation instead of server side rendering)
4. For any data fetching you must use Redux + Redux-thunk, you may also need to use next-redux-wrapper

## Bonus 🔥

1. Deploy your project to Vercel
2. Write automated tests (It is up to you what type of testing you want to implement)
 
## Submission
You should upload your code to a Github repository (private or public) and share it with me. Your repository should have a README.md that explains how to run the code and if you’ve done anything extra.



BEST OF LUCK! 😁
